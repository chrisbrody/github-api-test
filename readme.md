## GitHub Followers
# 1) Create a service that allows for a user to search for a GitHub username.
# 2) On a successful search return, display the user's GitHub handle, follower count, and a list of the user's followers (just the avatar is fine).
# 3) Create a "load more" button that, when clicked, fetches the next payload of followers. This button should persist until there are no more pages of followers to fetch. - gaearon,Â holman
